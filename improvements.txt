In our assignment 5 implementation of Shogi, we have made improvements to both the gameplay and the graphical user interface of our product. We have implemented the ability for users to drop captured pieces onto the board. To complement this addition, we have also created a drop menu visible to the user to see which of their pieces are available for drop. An “extra hard” level of difficulty has been added to the AI which was implemented with Monte Carlo Tree Search over the previous implementations with Alpha-Beta Pruning. We have also added the feature for users to replay and continue multiple games from the past instead of only the last game to be played. Now, the user is able to enter the name of an existing game file that they wish to resume or replay. In our previous program, if the user made an illegal move, it would automatically skip their turn, and turn to the opponents turn. We felt like this was too harsh of a rule, as the user may often accidentally misclick a coordinate, and skipping their turn would likely make the user less likely to enjoy our game. If the user makes an illegal move, we now prompt the user to start his move over again. In terms of visual presentation, we have centered the images of the pieces on the board so they no longer look out of place, and have replaced the evil Kermit image on our start menu with a more appropriate cover.
